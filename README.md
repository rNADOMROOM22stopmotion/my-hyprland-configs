Steps to take after running install.sh:

1. Install packages located in the .txt manually if install script fails.
2. Configure ufw and allow necessary ports (22, 80..).
3. Set up ly or any display manager you like after disabling the default one.
4. Other customisation include spicetify (spotify themeing) and custom firfox css which you'll have to figure out on your own.
5. Enjoy.


NOTE: most of the .conf files are not created by me (not original).

If you happen to own these and would like to remove/make this project private, my inbox is open. :D
